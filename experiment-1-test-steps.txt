The test steps are as follows.

1. Run server-manet on node N10.

2. Run server-manet on nodes N6 and N8.

3. Run server-manet on node N9.

4. Run client-manet on node N11. Node N11 sends data to node N10, which then sends data to nodes N1–N9.

5. Now, node N10 moves to a new location, which changes the network topology. The server-manet program is executed and elects node N9 as the new M-MSD. Node N10 changes to act as an S-MSD; however, it cannot visit M-MSD (N9) because of its disconnection from other nodes. The server-manet program is executed on nodes N6 and N8. Then, nodes N6 and N8 are elected as S-MSDs again and connected to the M-MSD.

6. The client-manet is executed again on node N11. Node N11 sends data to node N9, which then sends data to nodes N1–N8.

7. Now, node N10 moves to its original location, which again changes the network topology, and node N10 is re-elected as the M-MSD.

8. The client-manet is executed again on node N11. Then, node N11 sends data to node N10, which, in turn, sends data to nodes N1–N9.
